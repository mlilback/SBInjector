# SBInjector

This framework is a minimal dependency injection framework for macOS and iOS. It injects properties into (NS|UI)ViewControllers loaded from a storyboard.

Both [Typhoon](http://typhoonframework.org) and [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) are way more complicated than what I needed. Also, Swinject can't inject into subclasses, and it would require a pretty massive rewrite to support that.

This project was originally developed on macOS 10.12 using Xcode 8.3. It is written in Swift 3, using Objective-C only for the swizzling the view controllers. The latest version was built with XCode 11 on 10.14.6.

## Example

```
		let storyboard = NSStoryboard(name: "SomeFile", bundle: Bundle(for: type(of: self)))
		let context = InjectorContext()
		context.register(MyControllerSubclass.self) { controller in
			controller.name = "foo"
		}
		storyboard.injectionContext = context
		guard let vc = storyboard.instantiateController(withIdentifier: "storyboardIdentifier") as? MyControllerSubclass else { fatalError() }
		//any controller loaded from that storyboard will now have any appropriate values injected from context
```
